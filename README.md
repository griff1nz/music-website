# Music Website

## Description
I built this simple front-end application using React and Vite to promote my music lesson business. Users can read information about lessons as well as send messages to me via the contact form.

## Installation 
N/A

## Usage
The website will immediately show the user the main section. From there, the user can scroll or click any of the links at the top to view other sections.

## Credits
Thank you to my brother Cadin for providing feedback on my website!
